</p>

#### Packages/Dependencies Used:
- json-server
- react
- react-dom
- react-icons
- react-router-dom

This app was built following a ![React tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) from Traversy Media. The front end was built using React and CSS. The back end was built using json-server as the database and react-router-dom for routing.

## Optimizations:
In the future, I would like to make the following changes/build out the following features:
- Change the database to mongodb
- Edit tasks
- Make an account 
- Create multiple tasklists

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first experience building anything with React, so I was mostly trying to get a feel for the syntax and a better understanding of components and states. I'm really excited about the reusabilitiy of React components and the ability to render content and pages without refreshing the browser.
